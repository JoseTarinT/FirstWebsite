# FirstWebsite
Create a website with Flask

I will be making my first personal website with Flask, HTML and CSS.

    1. I have to create a folder(directory) called 'templates' where we will have the 'home.html' and 'about.html' files. It needs to be besides the 'script.py' file, at the top level.

    2. I'm going to create a navigation menu to navigate between the 'home' and 'about' pages. In order to do that IÂ´m going to create another .html file called 'layout.html' inside the 'templates' folder and link the 'home' and 'about' html files to the 'layout.html' file so that the 'layout.html' will be the base template and 'home' and 'about' will be the child templates.

    3. Create a CSS file and link it to the 'layout.html'
